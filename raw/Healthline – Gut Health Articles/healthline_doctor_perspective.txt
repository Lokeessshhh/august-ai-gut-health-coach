Your gut does more than digest food. It plays a key role in immunity, mood, metabolism, and overall health. Dr. Joseph Salhab shares how to support it and why it deserves more attention.

Gut health has become one of the buzziest topics in wellness, but how much of it is hype, and how much is truly essential to your long-term health?

To get clarity, we spoke with Dr. Joseph Salhab, a board certified gastroenterologist and popular health influencer known as @thestomachdoc on social media.

Dr. Salhab explains why your digestive system plays such a crucial role in everything from immunity to mental health and offers real, actionable advice on how to care for your gut without gimmicks, expensive cleanses, or crash diets.


Q: Why does gut health actually matter for our overall health?
According to Dr. Joseph Salhab, gut health is “foundational to our entire body’s well-being.” While most people think of digestion as just breaking down food, Dr. Salhab emphasizes that the gut plays a much larger role.

“Around 70% of your immune system lives in your gut,” he explains. “Your microbiome affects everything—metabolism, immunity, even brain function.”

There’s a direct line of communication between the gut and brain called the vagus nerve, and when the gut is inflamed, it can affect mood, contributing to conditions like anxiety and depression.

Dr. Salhab also points out that poor gut health doesn’t just affect mental well-being. In fact, it’s increasingly linked to chronic diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, autoimmune conditions, and even some cancers, including colorectal cancerTrusted Source.

Put simply, Dr. Salhab says: “Fixing your gut is like fixing the foundation of your house: once it’s stable, everything else works better.”

Q: From your perspective, what does it really mean to have good gut health?
“For me, good gut health means your digestive system is working smoothly and silently,” Dr. Salhab says. That includes having regular, comfortable bowel movements (ideally once a day) without frequent bloating, discomfort, or gas after meals.

But gut health goes beyond digestion. “Your energy levels should be stable, you should sleep better, and you shouldn’t feel sluggish after eating,” he adds. “Most people don’t realize how connected gut health is to sleep and energy.”

Q: What are some of the most common habits that can harm digestion over time?
Dr. Salhab points to ultra-processed foods as one of the biggest culprits. “A lot of people eat on autopilot, grabbing takeout or packaged foods without realizing what’s actually in them,” he says. “Cooking at home gives you control over ingredients and helps support your gut.”

He also highlights low fiber intake as a major issue. “Fiber is the fertilizer for your gut bacteria. Most people don’t get nearly enough,” he explains. Other common gut disruptors include alcohol, smoking, and vaping. “People forget that what you inhale can still affect your gut lining and digestive tract.”

And movement matters. “Lack of physical activity slows digestion and harms gut diversity. Even a short walk after dinner can make a big difference.”

Q: How do diet and nutrition impact gut health?
Dr. Salhab’s go-to advice: “Eat the rainbow.” That means including a wide range of colorful fruits and vegetables in your meals. “Different colors feed different types of beneficial bacteria,” he explains. “Diversity in your diet equals diversity in your microbiome.”

He frequently recommends foods like:

berries
leafy greens
sweet potatoes
whole grains
healthy fats like olive oil and avocado
“The more variety you get, the better your gut functions.”

Q: What role do fiber, probiotics, and fermented foods play?
Your gut is like a garden, Dr. Salhab says. “Fiber is the water and sunlight. It nourishes the soil so the plants can grow. Probiotics are the plants themselves.”

He recommends aiming for 25–35 grams of fiber daily from sources like beans, vegetables, whole grains, and fruit with the skin on.

For probiotics, naturally fermented foods are a top choice: “Yogurt with live cultures, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, and kombucha all help replenish good bacteria.”

Q: How much do stress and sleep really affect digestion?
“A lot more than people think,” Dr. Salhab says. Stress and lack of sleep can flare up symptoms like bloating, cramps, and constipation, especially in people with conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). “It’s a two-way street. Gut problems affect sleep and stress levels, and vice versa.”

He’s seen dramatic improvements in patients’ digestion simply by helping them manage stress better or get more consistent sleep. “You have to break the cycle. Supporting both gut health and mental health together is key.”

Q: What are the warning signs that your gut health needs medical attention?
There are some symptoms you should never ignore. According to Dr. Salhab, these include:

blood in your stool
ongoing changes in bowel habits
unexplained weight loss
severe or persistent abdominal pain
frequent heartburn
persistent nausea or feeling full quickly
“If something feels off for more than a few weeks, or your symptoms are getting worse, don’t wait. Talk with your doctor,” he advises. “Most gut issues are manageable if caught early.”

Q: Are gut health supplements or cleanses worth it?
“Supplements have their place, but they’re not a substitute for a healthy diet,” Dr. Salhab says. He occasionally recommends probiotics or digestive enzymes for specific symptoms, but only after understanding someone’s unique needs.

His biggest red flag? Colon cleanses. “These are often just powerful laxatives. They can disrupt your natural gut balance and do more harm than good,” he warns. “Your body already knows how to cleanse itself. You just need to support it with the right foods.”

Q: If someone wants to improve their digestion starting today, what should they do?
Dr. Salhab suggests beginning with small, easy wins that build momentum over time. “The key is to take simple steps you can stick with,” he says. Here are his top three:

Cook more meals at home: “Even one more meal a week can make a difference.”
Add colorful, antioxidant-rich foods: Try berries in your oatmeal or leafy greens in a smoothie.
Boost your fiber intake: “Track it. Make sure you’re hitting 25–35 grams daily.”
“Don’t try to change everything overnight,” he advises. “Start small, stay consistent, and your gut (and your overall health) will thank you.”

Takeaway
Gut health isn’t just a wellness trend. It’s a foundation for nearly every major system in your body. From supporting your immune defenses to regulating mood and preventing disease, your digestive health has wide-reaching impacts.

As Dr. Salhab reminds us, “You don’t need perfection. You need progress.” By making small, consistent choices, like eating more plants, managing stress, and paying attention to how your body responds, you can build a foundation for better digestion and better overall health.
